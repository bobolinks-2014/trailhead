This main trail and connecting loops, that crosses and follows the beautiful Pine Mountain ridge in west central Georgia, is inside the Franklin Delano Roosevelt State Park and near Callaway Gardens. Quiet woods, sparkling streams, misty waterfalls, rock outcroppings, varied forest, scenic overlooks, deer and turkey await your discovery. Just follow the blazes (6&quot; by 2 Ìâå_&quot; rectangles painted on trees). Two-foot-high rock cairns and mileage markers assist the hiker. Wooden location and mileage signs have been placed at each road crossing, trail head, junction, campsite, and at all named parking lots and trailheads. The Pine Mountain Trail offers clear crisp views of distant ridges in winter, with occasional snowfall. In the summer there are lush green ferns and lowland flowers. Wild flowers are abundant and in spring you will find flowering dogwood, native azalea, mountain laurel and rhododendron. Fall brings bright and beautiful leaves of hickory, oak, dogwood and maple, which change from day to day.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />In addition to the 23-mile main trail there are seven loops formed by connecting trails. In 2006, Pine Mountain Trail Association volunteers started and completed the 2.4 mile White Candle Trail section, which combined with the Beaver Pond Trail forms the newest loop, the 3.4 mile East End Loop.
